# ReleaseForm
A project I created to just learn Swift back in 2015. I's a digital release form for tattoo/piercing/cosmetics.
Unfortunately at the time iCloud was not able to have multiple different people signed into on iCloud account,
and so the way the forms were saved in the could account was not a fesable option for multiple employees to view, 
and edit the form. It was fun creating this app and learning about all sorts of wonderful Swift features. Maybe some
day when I Have some extra time I will revisit this project and really update things so that it works well.
